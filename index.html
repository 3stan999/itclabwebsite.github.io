        <h2><b>Who is Batman?</b> </h2>

        <p> Bruce Wayne, born to the wealthy and influential Wayne family, had a privileged upbringing.<br>
            His life changed forever when his parents, <i>Thomas and Martha Wayne</i>, were brutally murdered in front of him as a child.<br>
            This event triggered an obsession within Bruce to fight crime and avenge their deaths.<br>
        </p>

        <p> As he grew older, Bruce mastered a variety of martial arts and became an expert in detective work.<br> 
            He used his inherited wealth to transform his family's mansion into a secret base of operations, complete with a<br> 
            state-of-the-art Batcave and an array of advanced technology to aid him in his mission.<br>
        </p> 
        <p>
            Taking on the guise of the Batman, Bruce garnered a reputation as a fierce and intimidating vigilante.<br> 
            He fought against notorious criminals and deranged supervillains who threatened Gotham City, where he lived.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            One of his most infamous foes was <em>The Joker</em>, a criminally insane clown who enjoyed causing chaos and anarchy in the city.<br> 
            Batman's constant battles with The Joker caused him a great deal of mental and emotional strain,<br> 
            but he remained committed to his cause.<br>
        </p>    
        <p> Throughout his career, Batman worked closely with his trusted allies, including<br> 
            <b>Commissioner James Gordon</b>, <b>Robin<b/> (his young protégé), and the enigmatic <b>Catwoman</b>,<br>

            who had a complex and ambiguous relationship with him.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite his heroic feats, Batman was often seen as a dark and mysterious figure, <br>
            feared and mistrusted by many. However, he continued to fight for justice and to protect Gotham City,<br>
            even when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds.<br>
        </p>
        <p><i>
            Batman's legacy has endured long after his retirement, inspiring a new generation of crimefighters <br>
            and becoming a legend in his own right. His dedication to his cause, his exceptional skills, and <br>
            his unwavering determination have made him a beloved icon of heroism and justice in popular culture.<br>
